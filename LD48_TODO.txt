- Intro (if there's time): meteor collapsing into the world
- Level backdrop: horizontal mineshaft tunnels
- Tunnel platformer.  Focused on ceiling sticking and floaty gravity-less dashes to precisely avoid obstacles?

Before release:
- Search for any leftover print statements
- Disable debug mode in main
- Restore play mode in main
- Test briefly
- Create release build
- Re-test
- Check DLLs for any missing in release bundle
- Get someone else to test release bundle,s or test on another windows machine

Release:

Brief:
Short little hover physics platformer where you control a drone diving ever deeper into the abyss.

Controls:
wasd/arrow keys/dpad (game controller) to move.  Moving up will jump, moving down will temporarily stop hovering.  esc to quit.
The hover physics are a bit unusual.  The goal was to allow very precise horizontal movement, with an emphasis on clinging to walls and ceilings for positioning.  The physics is not very difficult to master but I think it turned out kinda neat.

Map editor controls:
Middle click to toggle between playing and not playing.  When not in playing mode, up/down to toggle between editor modes (editing, map select, playing).
In editing mode: left/right/a/d to cycle between selections.  Mouse to move cursor, and z to change brush selection to match what cursor is hovering over.
In map select mode: left/right to toggle between maps.
In playing mode: play normally.  Middle click to return to editing mode.
