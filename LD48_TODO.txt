- Intro (if there's time): meteor collapsing into the world
- Level backdrop: horizontal mineshaft tunnels
- Tunnel platformer.  Focused on ceiling sticking and floaty gravity-less dashes to precisely avoid obstacles?

- Disable debug mode in main
- Restore play mode in main
- Test briefly

- Re-test
- Check DLLs for any missing in release bundle
- Get someone else to test release bundle,s or test on another windows machine
